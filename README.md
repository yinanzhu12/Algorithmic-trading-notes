# Algorithmic-trading-notes
Research notes and code snipets related algorithmic trading. 

Currently, the focus is on US stock market. Aside from basic stuffs, I am interested in exploring using cluster algorithm to find
correlation/cointegration between time series so that one can use them for pair trading.

Many of codes here were written on quantopian and need their IDE to run.
